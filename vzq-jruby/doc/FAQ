	Q: Why this project?
	A: For the lulz. I wanted to create a game and to learn scala. Then I wanted to embed an interpreter.
	   I had problems achieving what I wanted. Then I switched to jruby, and I love it. It's so much more
	   faster (to compile) than scala. I thought that "when I have time" I would go back to scala.
	   Then I added the automatic code reloading system. And it's so much fun playing with this and ruby.
	   If one day, I settle on a gameplay, I will rewrite things in a faster language than ruby, and
	   finally get rid of those frames that take several times their 16ms, because of the GC every second
	   or so.

	Q: Did you actually get questions before writing this FAQ?
